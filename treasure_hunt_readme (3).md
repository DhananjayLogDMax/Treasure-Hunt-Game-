*Watch the epic treasure hunt adventure in action!*
</div>

<br>

Hey there, fellow code warrior! 👋 Welcome to what might just be the most ridiculously awesome text-based adventure you'll stumble upon today. This baby right here? It's a magical treasure hunt that'll have you questioning your life choices while simultaneously having the time of your life! 🎢

**🎓 Academic Achievement Unlocked**: This epic creation emerged from a DSA (Data Structures and Algorithms) project assignment, demonstrating that education becomes entertaining when you sprinkle in magical elements and cringe-worthy wordplay. Developed alongside my awesome buddy <a href="https://github.com/hritik-kumar" target="_blank">Hritik Kumar</a> 👦 who likely wonders about our sanity just as much as I question mine! 🤝💻

<br>

## 🤔 So... What Even IS This Thing?

Imagine you're stuck in a terminal (shocking, I know), but instead of staring at boring system logs, you're exploring a freaking CASTLE! 🏰 This isn't your grandma's text adventure - oh no, this is a full-blown quest where you get to:

- 🚶‍♀️ Wander around 10 different spooky/magical rooms
- 🧙‍♂️ Get quizzed by wizards who are WAY too smart for their own good
- 💀 Try not to die (spoiler alert: you might die)
- 💎 Actually find some legendary treasure if you're not completely hopeless

Think of it as Dungeons & Dragons meets Harry Potter meets "Why Did I Choose Computer Science Again?" 🎲⚡

<br><br><br>

## 🎯 What Makes This Game Absolutely Bonkers (In a Good Way)

- 🏠 **10 Wild Locations**: From creepy dungeons to fancy libraries (because even adventurers need to read sometimes)
- 🧙 **5 Wizard Encounters**: Each one more determined to stump you than the last
- 💖 **Lives System**: You get exactly 2 chances to not mess up completely
- 🗺️ **Map Feature**: Because getting lost in real life is bad enough
- 🎨 **Pretty Colors**: Your boring terminal just got a makeover!
- ⏰ **Timer**: So you can see exactly how long it took you to either win or fail miserably
- 👣 **Step Tracker**: For people who like numbers (you know who you are)

## 🚀 How to Actually Play This Thing

### 🎥 Installation Video Tutorial:

<div align="center">

https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/installation-tutorial-video-id

*Step-by-step installation guide for beginners*
</div>

<br>

### What You Need:
- A computer (obviously)
- A C compiler (GCC works great)
- Some basic Harry Potter knowledge (seriously, go watch the movies at least)
- Patience (more than Sheldon has for people who don't understand theoretical physics)
- Coffee (optional but highly recommended) ☕

<br>

### 📥 Getting It Running:

```bash
# Grab the code
git clone https://github.com/DhananjayLogDMax/magical-treasure-hunt.git

# Jump into the folder
cd magical-treasure-hunt

# Compile it (cross your fingers)
gcc -o treasure_hunt treasure_hunt.c

# Let the chaos begin!
./treasure_hunt
```

### For Windows Users (Our Condolences):
```cmd
# Use WSL or suffer in silence
# Or try: gcc treasure_hunt.c -o treasure_hunt.exe
```

<br><br>

### 🕹️ Actually Playing:

1. **Start**: Run the thing and get ready for an adventure
2. **Move**: Pick a direction (1=North, 2=South, 3=East, 4=West)
3. **Survive**: Answer wizard questions without having a mental breakdown
4. **Map**: Hit 5 to see where you've been (lifesaver!)
5. **Win**: Find that treasure room and claim victory
6. **Quit**: Press 6 if you need to rage quit (no judgment here)

### Controls (Because Apparently This Needs Explaining):
- **1** - Go North ⬆️ (up, away from your problems)
- **2** - Go South ⬇️ (down, toward your destiny)  
- **3** - Go East ➡️ (right, because left is wrong)
- **4** - Go West ⬅️ (left, but we don't talk about that)
- **5** - Show Map 🗺️ (for when you're hopelessly lost)
- **6** - Quit 🚪 (coward's way out)

## 🔧 The Nerdy Technical Stuff

<div align="center">
<img src="https://github.com/DhananjayLogDMax/Treasure-Hunt-Game-/blob/main/image/code-architecture.png" width="70%" alt="Code Architecture Diagram">
</div>

<br>

For my fellow programming enthusiasts who care about the behind-the-scenes magic:

This isn't just some thrown-together code from a late-night coding session (although those definitely happened). We've got:

<div align="center">
<img src="https://github.com/DhananjayLogDMax/Treasure-Hunt-Game-/blob/main/image/data-structures.gif" width="50%" alt="Data Structures Animation">
</div>

<br>

### 🏗️ Architecture That Actually Makes Sense:

- **Language**: C (because we hate ourselves and love pointers)
- **Room System**: Each location connects to others through a network of possibilities
- **Wizard Logic**: Questions with multiple choice answers and proper validation
- **Path Memory**: Stack-based tracking so you know where you've been
- **Input Handling**: Because users will try to break everything (it's a law of nature)
- **Pretty Output**: Color-coded text because plain white text is for quitters

```c
// Making terminals beautiful since forever
#define BLUE "\033[1;34m"    // For important headings
#define GREEN "\033[1;32m"   // For when you don't mess up
#define RED "\033[1;31m"     // For when you definitely mess up
```

### Code Statistics (That Nobody Asked For):
- **Lines of Code**: 400+ (every single one fought for)
- **Functions**: 15+ (decomposition is key, kids)
- **Structs**: Room, Wizard, Question (the perfect trio)
- **Debugging Hours**: We don't talk about those dark times
- **Caffeine Intake**: Probably unhealthy levels
- **Fun Factor**: Through the roof! 🚀

## 🐞 Things That Might Not Work Perfectly

Look, we're honest about our code:

1. **Hagrid's Answer**: Might be slightly off, but he's always been a bit confused anyway
2. **Memory Management**: We allocate things... freeing them is a work in progress
3. **Spelling**: "Dumbeldore" instead of "Dumbledore" - it's called character building!
4. **Wizards might judge your life choices** (working as intended)
5. **You might get addicted to this pointless game** (seek help)

These aren't bugs, they're "personality traits" of the software! 😅

<br><br><br>

## 🎓 What You'll Learn

This project is actually educational (surprise!):
- **Data Structures**: Arrays, structs, linked lists
- **Algorithms**: Pathfinding, validation, game state management  
- **C Programming**: Pointers, memory, modular design
- **Problem Solving**: Game logic and user experience
- **Pop Culture**: Harry Potter trivia (arguably the most important skill)

## 📚 The Story Behind This Madness

</div>

<br>

This whole project started as a **Data Structures and Algorithms assignment** that me and my awesome coding buddy decided to tackle together. Because nothing says "true friendship" like debugging pointer errors at 2 AM while running on nothing but determination and way too much caffeine! 👥💻

*"The best code is written by friends who aren't afraid to tell each other when their logic is completely wrong."* 🤝

Here's the thing: *"Every great programmer started with a simple game, a lot of curiosity, and an unhealthy relationship with their compiler."*
